This is what we use to pay Slingr's employees and contractors, or simply associates. 

Several parts come together in this feature, starting from the associate's **Work Agreement**, which allows to calculate their monthly **Compensation**. Using this information and taking into account any non-paid *Leaves*, HQ can calculate how much corresponds to each associate each month, creating what is called **Payroll Associates**. Once this information is available, the **Payroll Accountant** can create **Payroll Batches** that will distribute the money to the wallets of the Payroll Associates included in that batch.
